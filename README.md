Docker container with [sami](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Sami/)
documentation generator. The container is designed to build PHP API
documentation for [Korowai](https://github.com/korowai/korowai/) and
[Korowai Framework](https://github.com/korowai/framework/) out of the
box. It may be easily adjusted to support other projects.

## Features

With this container you can:

  - build documentation once and exit,
  - build documentation once and then serve it with http server,
  - build documentation continuously (rebuilding when sources change),
  - build documentation continuously and serve it at the same time.

The default behavior is to build continuously and serve at the same time.

## Quick example

Assume we have the following file hierarchy (the essential here is assumption
that php source files are found under `src`, also we expect the documentation
to be written-out somewhere under `docs`)

```console
user@pc:$ tree .
.
|-- docs
`-- src
    `-- Foo
        `-- Bar.php
```

### Running with docker

Run it as follows

```console
user@pc:$ docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/code" -p 8001:8001 korowai/sami
```

### Running with docker-compose

In the top level directory create `docker-compose.yml` containing the following

```yaml
version: '3'
# ....
services:
   # ...
   sami:
      image: korowai/sami
      ports:
         - "8001:8001"
      volumes:
         - ./:/code
```

Then run

```console
user@pc:$ docker-compose up sami
```

### Results

Whatever method you chose to run the container, you shall see two new directories

```console
user@pc:$ ls -d docs/*
docs/build docs/cache
```

The documentation is written to `docs/build/html/api`

```console
user@pc:$ find docs -name 'index.html'
docs/build/html/api/index.html
```

As long as the container is running, the documentation is available at

  - <http://localhost:8001>.

## Customizing

Several parameters can be changed via environment variables, for example we can
change build to ``build/docs/api`` dir as follows

```console
user@pc:$ docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/code" -p 8001:8001 -e SAMI_BUILD_DIR=build/docs/api korowai/sami
```

## Details

### Volume mount points exposed

  - `/code` - bind top level directory of your project here.

### Working directory

  - `/code`

### Files inside container

#### In `/usr/local/bin`

  - scripts which may be used as container's command:
      - `autobuild` - builds documentation continuously (watches
        source directory for changes),
      - `autoserve` - builds documentation continuously and runs
        http server,
      - `build` - builds documentation once and exits,
      - `serve` - builds source once and starts http server,
  - other files
      - `sami-defaults` - sets `DEFAULT_SAMI_xxx` variables (default
      - `sami-env` - initializes `SAMI_xxx` variables,
      - `sami-entrypoint` - provides an entry point for docker.

#### In `/etc/sami`

  - `sami.conf.php` - default configuration file for sami.

### Build arguments & environment variables

The container defines several build arguments which are copied to corresponding
environment variables within the running container. Most of the arguments/variables
have names starting with `SAMI_` prefix. All the `sami-*` scripts, and the
configuration file `sami.conf.php` respect these variables, so the easiest way
to adjust the container to your needs is to set environment variables (`-e`
flag to [docker](https://docker.com/)).  `KRW_CODE` and `SAMI_PORT` are
exceptions, they must be defined at build time, so they may only be changed via
docker's build arguments.
